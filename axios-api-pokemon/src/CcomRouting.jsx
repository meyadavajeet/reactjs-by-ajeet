            What is React-Router, anyway?
            Many modern websites are actually made up of a single page, they just look like multiple pages because they contain components that render like separate pages. These are usually referred to as SPAs - single-page applications. At its core, what React Router does is conditionally render certain components to display depending on the route being used in the URL (/ for the home page, /about for the about page, etc.).
